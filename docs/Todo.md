- Add offline mode. Want to be able to open a telemetry log (such as what this program dumps while running) and "Scroll" through it
- Come up with hooks for serial port data ingestion and other sources like CAN (refactoring network thread into a DataParser class and interface)
    - Call the class DataSink. Give it three methods - Open, Close, and Step. Provide it with a reference to the signal map (and whatever else is required) so that it can do what it needs to do.
- Lua embedding - this interface should support two (or three) usage types. 
    - Calculating new data based on packets. Idea is to have a lua callback run on receipt of specific packet, register a new signal in the signal map, and calculate it based on data available from the signal map. This will support whatever math can be programmed in lua
    - Lua will be used for the logic of the control elements in  GUI (to be added). Right now, it would need to support button callbacks and text input boxes. The Text input elements and buttons should be a generic element that can be instantiated by an "init" method in the lua script. For example, there might be a button for "Send Config", and three text inputs with labels for "heading", "mode", and "target". The user can type in the config boxes, and when the Send Config button is clicked, a lua callback will fire that has access to all of the data the gui provides (in this case, the contents of the dynamically defined text boxes).
    - Timers! This is to support things like Heartbeat (keep-alive) signals that an embedded device might require. It should be possible to register a timer (either one-shot or cyclic) in the lua script file, as well as a lua callback that gets called when the timer fires. This should also have access to the state variables of the gui, like the data provided in text boxes (thinking of the COM port to send data over or the IP/port to send a network packet).
